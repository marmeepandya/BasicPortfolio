    			<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">Minimalism is not a lack of something. It's simply the perfect amount of something said Nicholas Burroughs . Minimalism is about more than just possessions, though.  Minimalism is focusing on and committing to the fundamentals, instead of wasting time, money, or energy on details. Committing to the basics and mastering the fundamentals can be hard, though.</p>

    			<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">When you eliminate everything that is unnecessary, there are no details to hide behind. You’re left with just the basics and whether or not you have mastered them. As you'll see throughout this guide, a minimalistic approach can be applied to consumption, goals, schedules, tasks, design, and much more.</p>

    			<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">I want to tell you about something called The Diderot Effect to help explain why we want things we don't need.

The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption which leads you to acquire more new things. As a result, we end up buying things that our previous selves never needed to feel happy or fulfilled.

The effect is named for Denis Diderot, the co-founder and writer of Encyclopédie, who experienced a large windfall of wealth after living nearly his entire life in poverty. Shortly after, Diderot acquired a new scarlet robe. That’s when everything went wrong. 

Diderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he immediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by the rest of his common possessions. He soon felt the urge to buy some new things to match the beauty of his robe.</p>

    			<br>
    			<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">He replaced his old rug with a new one from Damascus. He decorated his home with beautiful sculptures and a better kitchen table. He bought a new mirror to place above the mantle and his straw chair was relegated to the antechamber by a leather chair. These reactive purchases have become known as the Diderot Effect. You can spot similar behaviors in many other areas of life: You buy a new dress and now you have to get shoes and earrings to match. You buy a CrossFit membership and soon you are paying for foam rollers, knee sleeves, wrist wraps, and paleo meal plans. You buy your kid an American Girl doll and find yourself purchasing more accessories than you ever knew existed for dolls. You buy a new couch and suddenly you’re questioning the layout of your entire living room. Those chairs? That coffee table? That rug? They all gotta go. Life has a natural tendency to become filled with more. We are rarely looking to downgrade, to simplify, to eliminate, to reduce. Our natural inclination is always to accumulate, to add, to upgrade, and to build upon.</p>

    			<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">Not only will minimalism save you time, money, and resources, it's also an important ingredient for success. If you want to be more productive, more focused, more creative, and exercise better willpower, it's essential that you absorb the principles of minimalism.

People often say that they want options. When it comes to getting things done, however, options aren’t always a good thing. When everything is a possibility, it actually becomes harder to make the right choice (or any choice at all). This is the paradox of choice.

Meanwhile, when we place a constraint on ourselves, it can become much easier to get something done.</p>

    			<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">The simplest way to get better is to eliminate your distractions. Want your software program to run faster? Delete every line of code that isn’t essential. Want to get stronger arms? Stop wasting energy on unrelated exercises. Want more people to read your blog? Stop distracting them with ads, buttons, and widgets. These choices have nothing to do with gaining new skills. They are simply about eliminating the things that are distracting from the essential. Learning to ignore, reduce, and remove the inessential choices can be just as beneficial as teaching yourself to make better ones.</p>

    		<p style="margin-top: 50px; text-align:justify;">Minimalism is also key to happiness to longevity. A recent article in the New York Times shared research on longevity that revealed that the people who live the longest not only live healthy lifestyles, but lso tend to engage and connect with the people around them. As a lot of people age, they tend to find themselves consuming more and creating less. Meanwhile, the people who keep on contributing tend to be the ones who keep on living. The message was clear. People who contribute to their community live longer. Creating and contributing to the world is not only a foundational piece of living a healthy and happy life, but also a meaningful one. You can’t control the amount of time you spend on this planet, but you can control what you contribute while you’re here. These contributions don’t have to be major endeavors. Cook a meal instead of buying one. Play a game instead of watching one. Write a paragraph instead of reading one. You don’t have to create big contributions, you just need to live out small ones each day.</p>
