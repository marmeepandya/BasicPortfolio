It’s quite simple: to be a minimalist you must live with less than 100 things, you can’t own a car or a home or a television, you can’t have a career, you must live in exotic hard-to-pronounce places all over the world, you must start a blog, you can’t have children, and you must be a young white male from a privileged background. Committing to the basics and mastering the fundamentals can be hard, though.</p>

But people who dismiss minimalism as some sort of fad usually mention any of the above “restrictions” as to why they could “never be a minimalist.” Minimalism isn’t about any of those things, but it can help you accomplish them. If you desire to live with fewer material possessions, or not own a car or a television, or travel all over the world, then minimalism can lend a hand. But that’s not the point. Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom. Freedom from fear. Freedom from worry. Freedom from overwhelm. Freedom from guilt. Freedom from depression. Freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around. Real freedom.</p>

The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption which leads you to acquire more new things. As a result, we end up buying things that our previous selves never needed to feel happy or fulfilled. The effect is named for Denis Diderot, the co-founder and writer of Encyclopédie, who experienced a large windfall of wealth after living nearly his entire life in poverty. Shortly after, Diderot acquired a new scarlet robe. That’s when everything went wrong. Diderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he immediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by the rest of his common possessions. He soon felt the urge to buy some new things to match the beauty of his robe.</p>

    			<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify; margin-right:100px;"><i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i> &nbsp; &nbsp; There are several advantages to minimalist living. Less clutter means less time spent cleaning or organizing and more hours in the day for family and friends. Minimalism allows us to focus on our priorities. Not only will minimalism save you time, money, and resources, it's also an important ingredient for success. If you want to be more productive, more focused, more creative, and exercise better willpower, it's essential that you absorb the principles of minimalism. People often say that they want options. When it comes to getting things done, however, options aren’t always a good thing. When everything is a possibility, it actually becomes harder to make the right choice (or any choice at all). This is the paradox of choice. Meanwhile, when we place a constraint on ourselves, it can become much easier to get something done.</p>

    			<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:justify;"><i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i> &nbsp; &nbsp; The easiest way to begin living a minimalist lifestyle is to assess both the people and things around you. &quote;When it comes to objects, you should ask yourself three questions,&quote; Monte explains. &quote;Do I use it? Do I love it? And do I need it?&quote; If the item lacks purpose or passion, it probably also lacks a place in your life however, the application of this is easier said than done. The simplest way to get better is to eliminate your distractions. Want your software program to run faster? Delete every line of code that isn’t essential. Want to get stronger arms? Stop wasting energy on unrelated exercises. Want more people to read your blog? Stop distracting them with ads, buttons, and widgets. These choices have nothing to do with gaining new skills. They are simply about eliminating the things that are distracting from the essential. Learning to ignore, reduce, and remove the inessential choices can be just as beneficial as teaching yourself to make better ones.</p>

A recent article in the New York Times shared research on longevity that revealed that the people who live the longest not only live healthy lifestyles, but lso tend to engage and connect with the people around them. As a lot of people age, they tend to find themselves consuming more and creating less. Meanwhile, the people who keep on contributing tend to be the ones who keep on living. The message was clear. People who contribute to their community live longer. Creating and contributing to the world is not only a foundational piece of living a healthy and happy life, but also a meaningful one. You can’t control the amount of time you spend on this planet, but you can control what you contribute while you’re here. These contributions don’t have to be major endeavors. Cook a meal instead of buying one. Play a game instead of watching one. Write a paragraph instead of reading one. You don’t have to create big contributions, you just need to live out small ones each day.</p>
